Description of solution:

Create an instance of a binary search tree.	for (h = 4 to 12){  n =  2^h - 1  for (entry = 1 to n)  {    // Use  Math.random() to get a random number between 0.0 and     // up to but not including 1.0; create a new data value    Double data = new Double(Math.random())    // Use the method contains to see whether data is already in the tree    while (data is already in the tree)      data = new Double(Math.random())    Add data to the tree  }  Compute the height of the tree  Display the height, h, and n  Clear the tree}...............................................
The output should look something like this (The values in the first column for the actual height are not intended to be accurate):Height  h      n 6      4	  15	 9      5	  31	13      6	  64	15      7	 127	15      8	 255	19      9	 511	20     10	1023	23     11	2047	25     12	4095
